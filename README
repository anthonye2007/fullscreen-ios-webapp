This shows how to disable the browser bar (back button, url search bar etc).
This only works on iOS devices.

To make it work:
1. Clone this repo
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start
1. Navigate to localhost:8080 on your computer's browser and verify some text appears
1. Use Safari on a iOS device and connect to <your.computer.ip>:8080. Note nothing is different yet.
1. Add this page to your home screen via the Share button
1. Use the newly added home screen icon to open the app -- observe no browser bar!!
